# Application-of-Deep-Learning-in-Image-Processing

## Preface
* This tutorial is a summary of the research content of my postgraduate period, and I hope to help more partners at the same time. Later, if there is new knowledge learned, it will be shared with everyone.
* This tutorial will be shared in the form of video. The teaching process is as follows:
1) Introduce the structure and innovation of the network
2) Use Pytorch to build and train the network
3) Use Tensorflow (internal keras module) to build and train the network
