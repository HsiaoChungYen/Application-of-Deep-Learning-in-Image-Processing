# Detailed Explanation of AlexNet Network Structure and Model Construction

AlexNet is the champion network of the 2012 ILSVRC 2012 (ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge) competition, and the classification accuracy has increased from 70%+ of the traditional method to 80%+ (the traditional method has entered the bottleneck period at that time, so such a big improvement is very good of). It was designed by Hinton and his student Alex Krizhevsky. It was also after that year that deep learning began to develop rapidly. The following figure is a network structure diagram taken from the original AlexNet paper.
